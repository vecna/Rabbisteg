0) what's a steganography library written in javascript ?

steganography is explained on wikipedia: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Steganography (not really accurate, btw)
RabbiSteg is a javascript library to provide an integration/extension of the browser capability, instead the production of a single software implementing a steganographic tool, like the various collected in http://members.cox.net/ebmmd/stego/stego.html

1) philosophical goal

anonymity community, security integralists, crypto rebels: yours is an idea. your idea will not be stopped, and in the world we're facing, our effort are commonly misunderstand. Rabbi, one of the first man contributing in this goal, recenlty has passed out. Only the flash is mortal, not the ideas, neither the technology. This software are is to him dedicated, in him memory and by remind for every other contributor in anonymous technology: you are contributing in a common, shared, permanent knowledge, you will not be forgotten. You share with us a paranoid approach to the technology, but instead of succumb, you're creating a solution. this effort remain forever.
