## Rabbisteg - steganography since 4 to 7 layer

In memory of Len `rabbi` Sassaman - cypherpunk code last forever.

### 'steganography' ?

In these years, finally [1], the protection technology has started to be apprecciated, understanded, seeked and used. Good. We from the #FirstWorld have to say a permanent **Thank you** to Edward Snowden, who at least awake the security needs of everyone.

But, in the present+future panopticon scenario, where the technology keep their usage restricted in order to collect more metadata from the users, and where the infrastructure are pervasively monitored for espionage/control/security purpose.. Cryptography will not be the best answer.

Inside the big world of the Information Hiding, beside cryptography, other techniques exists: Cover Channel and Steganography are the two relevant here.

Why they are relevant ? 

  * because in the free online services [2] the unidirectional law of the Term of Services can easily forbid the usage of cryptographical technology. For example: a social network plugin that encrypt message before post them. But, they can forbid only what they can spot. What if they can't automatically spot and detect encrypted message ? This is one goal of the **information hiding**
  * because in the panopticon world where everyone is considered a threat for the status quo, everyone that try to escape this control si consider a threat too. **Information hiding**, again, solve this problem.

## Covert Channel and Steganography

**They differs!**

1: finally for a cypherpunk point of view. because since forever in this environment we sayd 'I told you have to protect yourself', not because this is the life we prefer, but because the only way to be safe in the network is **being always protected from your potential threat**, and now, finally, the fact that Internet is not a cats and porn paradise start to be clear ;)
2: free like a 0 cost press distributed near an underground station, not 'free' like 'freedom'.
