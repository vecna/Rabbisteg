## Old PHP tests

Those tests, useful, had show that recursion is a painful experience, if not managed correclty :P

# Why in PHP ?

The final Goal of stegoclick is provide a javascript client, (installed as plugin) that take as input a string (or a binary) and convert it in a series of HTTP request.

In the server side, a wordpress plugin can collect those requests and extract communication. 

The PHP section is required for wordpress integration, than make a research in that language was acceptable. No, in fact was not, was a complete useless ass pain, use a pseudo low level language, in the wrong layer.

Then I'm rewriting in python the tests, but would require a future porting in both JS and PHP.
